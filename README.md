# Hacker Match - 'Find your perfect hacking partner.'

## What are you waiting for? Your new hacking partner is just a swipe away! 
Have you ever wanted to work on a specific project for a hackathon, but had difficulty finding teammates with the right skills and experience? Worry no more, Hacker Match is here. Through its simple user-friendly interface, Hacker Match allows Hackers to match with new teammates with just a swipe! <br/>  

Better yet, the application is developed using React Native and runs on both ios and Android. <br/> 

(This app was developed during NWHacks 2020 held at The University of British Columbia. The app utilizes a sample database of users for demonstration purposes.)
